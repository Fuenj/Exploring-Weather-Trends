# Exploring-Weather-Trends
The primary goal of this project is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.

## Project overview
In this project, i will create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live. To do this, i’ll follow the steps below:
- Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures, by ploingt the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends, by responding to these questions:

Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?</li>
How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?</li>
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?


## Project objectives
This is a project that I was working on for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It is just an initiation to data analysis, to be able to manipulate data in python , create a clear data visualization and interpret the resuts.

## Loading project requirements
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
</ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>CSV</li>
</ul>
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook. 
## Evaluation
My project was reviewed by a Udacity reviewer. All criteria found in the rubric must be meeting specifications for me to pass.
